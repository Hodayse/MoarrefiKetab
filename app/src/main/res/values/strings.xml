    Semi-Invasive
ECoG
Electrocorticography uses electrodes placed on the exposed surface of the brain to measure electrical activity from the cerebral cortex. It is called semi-invasive but it still requires a craniotomy to implant the electrodes. For this reason it is used only when surgery is necessary for medical reasons (epilepsy for example).
The electrodes may be placed outside the dura mater (epidural) or under the dura mater (subdural). The strip or grid electrodes covers a large area of the cortex (from 4 to 256 electrodes)(2), allowing a diverse range of cognitive studies.
The positive characteristics of ECoG are:
•	high spatial resolution and signal fidelity
•	resistance to noise
•	lower clinical risk and Robustness over long recording period[1]
•	higher amplitude

There have been different studies about the use of ECoG in BCI, but they are all limited to cases where surgery was needed to remove an epileptic focus.
